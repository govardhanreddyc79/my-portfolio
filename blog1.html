        <p>Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas are central govt schools run by Navodaya Vidyalaya Samithi, an autonomous organization under the department of School Education and Literacy, Ministry of Education, Government of India. It was started with establishment of one navodaya vidyalaya each in Haryana and Maharashtra in 1984.
            </p>

        <p>Every district of the country has one Navodaya Vidyalaya except tamilnadu. The main intention in opening of vidyalaya in every district of the country is to find the talented children from rural areas and provide them quality education like corporate schools without any cost. The selection of candidates will be done through entrance test based on merit. While there are some reservations for different sections in the society, but 75% seats are reserved for candidates from rural areas.</p>

        <p>The three main objectives of Navodaya Vidyalaya are: <br>
            <span>
            1.	National Integration <br>
            2.	Provide Quality Education for rural children <br>
            3.	To aid and strengthen other institutions in the surrounding areas.
        </span>
        </p>
        <p>

            To promote national integration among students, a policy called “Migration policy” is employed. It is an exchange of students between Hindi and non-Hindi speaking districts which takes place for one academic year that is in class 9. Through which students get to know about different cultures and rich heritages of the country.
            Quality education will be provided for the selected students along with food, clothes, books, stationary and all necessary items to stay in dormitory and all-round development of every student is the primary focus. Vidyalaya will provide necessary support to the students from remote areas nearby by allocating some time to use Vidyalaya labs and provide chance to participate in cultural and sports events thus becomes part of other school children’s growth.
