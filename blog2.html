                <p>Rich dad Poor dad is one of the best books I have read in recent times. In this book the author Robert Kiyosaki talks about basics about how money works and difference between an asset and a liability. He describes an asset as something which puts money in your pocket and a liability as something which takes the money from your pockets. He talks about mindset of both his poor dad and rich dad. Poor dad mainly concentrates on going to school, securing good grades and getting high paying job. He focuses mainly job security. Whereas rich dad concentrates on how money works and invests time in gaining financial education so that later on he can use his learning to make money works for him.

                <p>EHere, Robert discusses three points mainly. They are: <br><br>
                    <span>The Rich don’t work for money: </span> 
                        The poor and middle-class people work their entire life for money because whenever they get a paycheck, they spend that money on the things that they think are assets like cars, electronics, mobile phones etc.  whereas rich use their paycheck to accumulate some assets so that their assets get them more money by working 24/7. <br><br>
                    <span>The power of corporations:</span> Rich use their corporations to pay less tax as their earnings are taxed after they deduct expenditure from it whereas poor and middle class are taxed on their earnings directly. <br><br>
                    <span>Learn financial literacy:</span> Rich invests most of their time in learning about accounting, investing etc so that they can manage their own money effectively without depending on others. In other case poor and middle class focus on working for somebody else to get paycheck then depend on other people to manage their money

                <p>
                    <span class="formula">
                        Rich people: 
                        Income – Savings = Expenses </span><br><br>
                        <span class="formula">Poor people:
                            Income – Expenses = Savings</span>
