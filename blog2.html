        <h2>Section-1</h2>
        <p>Few days back, I was tasked on a project. This app will be written in React. State management will be with Apollo with a backend in GraphQL. The way I learn new things is I do a very basic course to get the feel of it. I look for a free course, so that I can share it with the community. GraphQL being relatively new has fewer courses online. I did find a lot of resources both free and paid which I will review some day but this one course stands out. I have recommended this course to a lot many people I know.</p>
